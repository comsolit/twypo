Twig for TYPO3

## How to use it
1. `cd path/to/your/typo3conf/ext && git clone https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/twypo.git --recursive`
2. Install/Enable the "Twypo" extension inside your Backend
3. In `Include static (from extensions):` of your main template add the voice `Twypo: Default Setup`.
4. Refresh your page and you're done.

## Is it ready for production?
Nope, it's not.

But it's a Kickstart that a lot of guys at [cron IT GmbH](http://www.cron.eu) helped me on starting this project.

## Why?
Simply because there were a lot of POC but none of them was a working extension like "drop-in and run". So, this is my own effort to bring this kind of logic to the people that want to use it.

## What can you do for me?
If you're a TYPO3 developer, you can help me to scrape the data from the system to arrays/dictionaries. Also, the backend should be extended to give the user the choice of which template to use per page.

If you're a user, then just wait for it to be ready.

## Which is the license of this project?
